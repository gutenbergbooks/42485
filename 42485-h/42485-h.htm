<h2>"LONDON AND LIVERPOOL&mdash;LITTLE AND GOOD."</h2>

<p>It appears that the very excellent proposal
of amalgamating all the local branches of
the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to
Children in one national association is meeting
with some opposition in Liverpool. Says
the <em>Courier</em> of that important locality, "It
was Liverpool which educated London in the
matter of child-protection, and probably the
Londoners could still learn in Liverpool many
practical lessons. And just when Liverpool
is about to be trebled in extent, and have its
population largely increased, seems a singularly
inappropriate time to subordinate the
city to London." From this it would appear
that Liverpool in its growth is becoming, to
use a colloquialism, "too big for its boots."
Surely the benefit of the children should be
the first consideration. What the size of
either Liverpool or London has to do with
that matter, it is difficult to say. No doubt
Londoners could learn much from their Liverpool
brothers. But the lesson for the moment
is to discover how to best protect the little
ones. And that subject can only be mastered
by a display of goodwill and unselfishness on
both sides.</p>

<h3>A BAS "THE CLUB SWEEP."</h3>

<p><span class="sc">Dear Mr. Punch</span>,&mdash;Although you are a
humorist, there is a serious side to your
character. I want to appeal to that serious
side. I wish to complain of the prevalence in
all our West-End Co-operative Palaces of that
annual pest, appropriately called "the Club
Sweep." Why should it be allowed to
prosper? It is a disgrace to civilisation. I
know of no more painful sight than the picture
of old <span class="sc">Cr&oelig;sus</span> paying the hall-porter to put
him down for a dozen places. I am delighted
when those twelve positions end in blanks, or
starters out of the running. And nearly as
unpleasant an incident is the tableau of young
<span class="sc">Jones</span> taking a pound chance at the same
fatal lottery. Put it down, <em>Mr. Punch</em>; put
it down. I repeat, "the Club Sweep" is unworthy
of the civilisation of the close of the
nineteenth century. Once more, Sir, put it
down.</p>

<p class="author1">Yours, most truly,</p>

<p class="author"><span class="sc">An Old Member of the Hercules Club</span>.</p>

<p>P.S.&mdash;I am sure the thing is a mistake. Will
you believe it, I have put into my own sweep
for the last thirty-five years, and have never
drawn a starter! Same luck this season!</p>

<h3>From the New Sarum Note-Book.</h3>

<p class="center">
[Lord <span class="sc">Salisbury</span> "believes the <span class="sc">Sultan</span> to be a

</p>

<p class="ind1"><span class="sc">Lord Salisbury</span> believes&mdash;</p>

<p class="ind1">That <span class="sc">Richard the Third</span> was a remarkably
amiable man; especially kind to children.</p>

<p class="ind1">That <span class="sc">Nero</span> was the gentlest creature that
ever breathed, except <span class="sc">Caligula</span>.</p>

<p class="ind1">That <span class="sc">Henry the Eighth</span> was a gentle, unassuming

in fact, a model husband, and the

<hr class="medium" />

<h3>ROUNDABOUT READINGS.</h3>

<p>The Hon. <span class="sc">George Curzon</span> and Miss <span class="sc">Leiter</span> (U.S.A.) have been
married. The State of Illinois is indignant. The two facts are
more intimately connected than might be supposed. Four days after
the wedding a resolution was introduced into the State Legislature
of Illinois by a Mr. <span class="sc">McCarthy</span>, requesting the daughters of Illinois
"not to accept the hand in marriage of any person who is not a
citizen of the United States, as we are of opinion that the daughters
of Illinois should be patriotic in their views, and should disregard
the title of any foreigner, and marry none but a citizen of the
United States." It is stated that the resolution "was referred to
the Committee on Federal Relations." Surely a Committee on
domestic relations or on titled relations would have been more
appropriate.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>The Illinois State Legislature obviously has novel ideas of its
legislative duties. Imagine an English County Council treating
seriously such fantastic rubbish as Mr. <span class="sc">McCarthy</span> brought before
the law-makers of his State. Would it not be more to the point to
look after the sons of Illinois, and to keep the hue of their resolution
up to the mark? If they are laggards in love, who shall blame the
British aristocrat for wooing with success the daughters of Illinois,
whom their compatriot suitors abandon? Or again, if titles are so
irresistible an attraction to the fair, why not establish titles in
Illinois, and thus give the Earl of <span class="sc">Bangs</span> or the Marquis <span class="sc">Saltontale</span>
that seductive influence which is apparently lacking to plain
<span class="sc">Zedekiah B. Bangs</span>, and to the unadorned <span class="sc">Jonathan K. Saltontale</span>.
For it is obviously better that the daughters of Illinois should marry
than that they should waste away with an unbridaled (let the
spelling pass) desire for a title.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>At Oxford on Wednesday last the University beat Somerset by one
wicket, mainly owing to the admirable batting of Mr. <span class="sc">H. D. G. Leveson
Gower</span>, popularly known as "The Shrimp."</p>

<div class="poem width24">  <div class="stanza">
<p>To the batsmen of Oxford, who looked very limp,</p>
<p>Father Neptune was kind when he gave them a Shrimp:</p>
<p>For a Shrimp on the grass is most worthy of rhyme,</p>
<p>When he makes a firm stand, but gets runs all the time.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>The inhabitants of Christmas Street in Bristol want to have their
thoroughfare laid with wood paving. At present, according to an indignant
correspondent, "the pitching in the street is so bad that it
is positively dangerous for vehicular traffic ... but the risk to life
and limb are entirely subservient to the parsimonious policy of our
Bristol Sanitary Authority." Might I suggest Yule logs as an
appropriate pavement for Christmas Street? Certainly this accident
policy of the Bristol Sanitary Authority ought to be allowed to lapse.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>I gather from a letter in the <em>Freeman's Journal</em> that Bray is not
being well treated by the Bray Township Commissioners. "If Bray
is to march with the times," says the writer, "and keep pace with
the laudable efforts of our Tourist Development Association," something
must be done to improve the walk round Bray Head. The
picture of Bray keeping pace and marching with the times by walking
round its own head is too confusing for the intelligence of the
dense Saxon.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>An article in the <em>Scotsman</em> declares that "a great laxity of costume
is characteristic of modern Oxford." Straw hats and brown
boots appear to abound everywhere. It is added that "Bowlers are
already beginning to be preserved as relics of a bygone race." This
will be glorious news for the Cambridge Eleven, for a merely preserved
bowler cannot be very dangerous.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<blockquote><p>From a recent issue of the <em>Freeman's Journal</em> I extract the following
letter, which, it must be admitted, "makes both sides right"
with a clearness that leaves nothing to be desired. Note, too, the
writer's natural vexation at the idea that he "assisted the constable":&mdash;
</p></blockquote>

<h3>TO THE EDITOR Of THE FREEMAN.</h3>

<p class="indr"><em>114, Lower Clanbrassil Street, Dublin, May 14, 1895.</em></p>

<p><span class="sc">Sir</span>,&mdash;With reference to your issue of the 13th inst., and the stolen tea
from one of the London and Northern-Western vans, I beg leave to state that
I in no way assisted the constable in the arrest of the prisoner, as you state;
neither was there any necessity for me doing so, as he had sufficient help
along with him at the time. But I did help the driver of the waggon when
on the ground to recover his feet and get back to his waggon with the tea in
question. My reasons for doing so were as follows&mdash;first, being a van driver
myself, and I might say has been such all my lifetime, and knowing that
when goods are stolen from any van in nine cases out of every ten the driver
of such a van has to make good the same and be put under stoppages although
no fault of his. Secondly, when I came on the scene the driver of the
waggon seemed to be getting the worst of it, as the offender had two others
helping him. If someone did not interfere, therefore, under those circumstances
and to protect the interest of my fellow-workers, as I am always
ready to do, I interfered, and under no other.&mdash;Hoping you will kindly insert
this in your next issue and make both sides right, and thanking you for the
same, I remain your humble servant,</p>

us a real good show. The Olympian <span class="sc">Bossy

of the natives from Islington to Kensington,
and Sir <span class="sc">Druriolanus</span>
must have owned
that the military managers
have run him
very close as a master
of crowds and of thrilling
dramatic situations.
Who would not
rush out to fight
Zulus, or any other
savages, to stirring
sounds of First Horse
Guards' band, and
cheered by all sorts and
kinds of inspiriting music? You march to a
popular song, you build bridge to polka, you
make zerebas to the lilt of a waltz, you charge
to a galop, and you return victorious to the
National Anthem! Hurrah for the life of a
soldier, at Islington!</p>

<p>Here the Art of Artillery Driving can be
seen to perfection: three times round, clear
posts and out again to deafening cheers.
Bayonet exercise of Second Battalion Scots
Guards is full of point; while the display
made by Gymnastic Staff of Egyptian Army
shows how our soldiers can advance by leaps
and bounds. Excellent device! Enemy dumbfounded
and bothered to see our athletic
warriors jumping over one another's heads,
turning somersaults, and finally heaping
themselves up into pyramids&mdash;a real Egyptian
puzzle this&mdash;with hero at apex waving
flag. Why, a whole army of fiercest enemies
would take to their heels rather than fight
with these dancing dragoons, and hosts of
Mussulmans would flee before such men of
muscle. For these tactics no arms required
except those already naturally belonging to
the corps. So inexpensive! Yet to these
merry infants-in-arms the art of war is no
child's-play.</p>

<p>The new effects, and one among the numerous
attractions, is the Grand Historical Military
Pageant, performed with the greatest
success by the 3rd King's Own Hussars and
the Buffs. Nothing
buffo about the
Buffs. They appear
as Cavalier
cavalry and infantry
pikemen
of <span class="sc">James The
Second's</span> time,
and as cavalry
and infantry from
that date down
through the Georgian
period to the
present day. The
great change is
noticeable in the
hair, from long
flowing curls and
periwigs to the
short crop of <span class="sc">Thomas Atkins</span>. Altogether
a brilliant success, and should bring in a
handsome amount for the benefit of the Military
Charities, to whose funds this show
makes an invaluable contribution.</p>

<p class="ind1"><em>Brown.</em> No, I think not. Fact is, the place
gets duller year by year. The train has
knocked the fun out of the road.</p>

<p class="ind1"><em>Jones.</em> Such a waste of time. Why go in
a crowd to see some horses race, when you
can read all about it in evening papers?</p>

<p class="ind1"><em>Brown.</em> Just so. No fun. No excitement.
And the Downs are wretched if it rains or
snows.</p>

<p class="ind1"><em>Jones.</em> Certainly. The luncheon, too, is all
very well; but, after all, it spoils one's dinner.</p>

<p class="ind1"><em>Brown.</em> Distinctly. And champagne at
two o'clock is premature.</p>

<p class="ind1"><em>Jones.</em> And lobster-salad undoubtedly indigestible.
So it's much better not to go to
the Derby&mdash;in spite of the luncheon.</p>

<p class="ind1"><em>Brown.</em> Yes,&mdash;in spite of the luncheon.</p>

<p class="ind"><em>Two hours pass. Scene changes to Epsom.</em></p>

<p class="ind1"><em>Jones.</em> Hullo! You here?</p>

<p class="ind1"><em>Brown.</em> Hullo! And if it comes to that,
you here, too?</p>

<p class="ind1"><em>Jones.</em> Well, I really found so little doing
in town that I thought I might be here as
well as anywhere else.</p>

<p class="ind1"><em>Brown.</em> Just my case. Not that there's
much to see or do. Silly as usual.</p>

<p class="ind1"><em>Jones.</em> Quite. Always said the Derby was
a fraud. But I am afraid, my dear fellow, I
must hurry away, as I have got to get back
to my party for luncheon.</p>

I like the friverolity and

of the thing,

sez, "Jacky," she sez, "I

take this 'ere money and
lay it out among 'em in
moieties, and make 'em
rich and 'appy." You can
see for yourselves. I've
no tickets and no parryfernalia,

pocket-book, where I enter
any bets you honour me
with. Come, Miss, win a
pair o' those three-and-sixpenny gloves at <span class="sc">Chickerell's</span>, the ex-Mayor's,
to oblige <em>me!</em> Did I tread on your corn, Sir? I assure you
it was the last thing I intended.... "You knew I'd do it afore I'd
done?" ... Well, Sir, if you've sech a gift o' seeing into futoority as
that, why not make something out of it now? Three to one bar one.
<em>Kitty</em> <em>I</em>'m barring. Thank <em>you</em>, Sir; 'alf-a-crown to seven and six
on <em>Sportsman</em>. I tell you candidly&mdash;you've got the winner. The
favourite won't win. Now, then, all you others, where's your Baymouth
pluck? I orfered you thirty to one <em>Beeswing</em> last race; and
you wouldn't take it. And <em>Beeswing</em> won, and you lost the chance
o' making yer fortunes. Don't blame <em>me</em> if the same thing 'appens

<h2 class="sb">OPERATIC NOTES.</h2>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 100px;"><a href="images/257a-240.png"><img src="images/257a-100.png" width="100" height="261" alt="Miss Marie Engle, a charming, spritely Zerlina" /></a></div>

<p><em>Monday.</em>&mdash;Crowded house: all charmed with everything and
everybody in <em>Fra Diavolo</em>. Somebody in grand tier so ecstatically
pleased, that, unable any longer to control impulsive movement, he
(or she) hurls into the air leather lorgnette case, which, descending
at an angle, clears the Prince of <span class="sc">Wales's</span> elbow by a few inches,
and startles musical enthusiast who, seated at corner of third row
of stalls, is at that moment wrapped up in the opera, and thus protected
against most external dangers. A thrill went through the
house! is it a "B-o-m-b" bomb? <span class="sc">Bevignani</span>, pausing, <em>bâton</em> in
air, gives the horrorstruck singers and concealed
orchestra (to whom pause is inexplicable) a few
notes rest. Then corner (stall) man picks up lorgnette
case, fortunately empty; whereupon the Bold
<span class="sc">Bevignani's</span> <em>bâton</em> is once more in motion, and
everyone is "as they were." <span class="sc">Arimondi</span> and <span class="sc">Pini-Corsi</span>
earn a big encore for duet and dance. Mr.
<span class="sc">David Bispham</span> with Madame <span class="sc">Amadi</span>, as <em>Milor'</em> and
<em>Miladi</em>, speaking English and queer Italian, do
good service. <em>Fra Diavolo-Lucia</em> excellent, and
Miss <span class="sc">Marie Engle</span> (who naturally quite understood
<em>Milor'</em> and <em>Miladi</em> when speaking Engelish)
a charming, sprightly <em>Zerlina</em>. Revival decided hit.</p>

<p><em>Wednesday.</em>&mdash;<span class="sc">Verdi's</span> opera, <em>Falstaff</em>. Some
charming music in it; otherwise dull opera. Impossible
to put <em>Falstaff</em> himself, singing or speaking,
on any stage. Actor or singer invariably over-weighted.
<span class="sc">Zelie de Lussan</span>, looking like <em>Jessica</em>,
sings <em>Anne Page's</em> music charmingly. <span class="sc">Shakspeare</span>
created "sweet <span class="sc">Anne Page</span>" the daughter
of <em>Mrs. Page</em>. Why then, in the opera, is she put
into the <span class="sc">Ford</span> family? I refer to the "Characters" in the book of the
opera, where I find "<em>Mistress Ford</em>," and "<em>Anne, her daughter</em>."
<span class="sc">Giulia Ravogli</span> a sprightly <em>Dame Quickly</em>; <span class="sc">Pauline Joran</span> a
lively <em>Mistress Ford</em>; and Signor <span class="sc">de Lucia</span> an amiable <em>Fenton</em>,
"with a song."</p>

<p><em>Friday.</em>&mdash;House not absolutely crowded to hear <em>Carmen</em>. Is
<em>Carmen</em> a bit "off"? Yet nothing better than performance of
<span class="sc">Zelie de Lussan</span> as gay and wicked heroine. Little <em>Don José de
Lucia</em> first-rate, and <span class="sc">Ancona</span> winning encore for old friend <em>Toréador</em>.
<span class="sc">Marie Engle</span> excellent goody-goody contrast to bold, bad <em>Carmen</em>.
Police-constable <span class="sc">Bevignani</span>, <em>bâton</em> in hand, severe when on the beat.
In honour of <span class="sc">Queen's</span> Birthday, Sir <span class="sc">Druriolanus</span> troupe-ing <em>Il
Trovatore's</em> operatic colours at Windsor Castle. It ought to have
been, appropriately, <em>Falstaff</em>.</p>

<p><em>Saturday.</em>&mdash;<em>Faust.</em> "House full." <em>The</em> Princess and Princesses
present. <span class="sc">Melba's</span> "Jewel song" a gem. <span class="sc">M. Plançon</span>, whose
name, Britishly pronounced, suggests "Mr. <span class="sc">Plain-song</span>," rather
ecclesiastical than diabolical, a highly-coloured but generally effective
<em>Mephistopheles</em>. Mdlle. <span class="sc">Brazzi</span> appears to-night as "the new
woman" in the part of <em>Siebel</em>. "She rouses enthusiasm," quoth
<span class="sc">Wagstaff</span>, "no Siebil-lation." <em>Exeunt omnes.</em></p>

<h2>THE DISCOVERY OF LONDON.</h2>

<p><em>Interviewer.</em> As a keen student of your fascinating works, permit
me to render to you my respectful homage.</p>

<p><em>Distinguished Foreigner in London.</em> Certainly. I observe that you
speak the French of the capital with fluency.</p>

<p><em>Int.</em> You flatter me. I am only an
ordinary journalist. Possibly you prefer
to converse in our local language?</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 150px;"><a href="images/257b-380.png"><img src="images/257b-150.png" width="150" height="186" alt="Distinguished Foreigner in London" /></a></div>

<p><em>D. F.</em> On the contrary, I have only
recently acquired the English word, "Yes."
Curiously enough, this is my first voyage
of discovery to your shores. I had, of
course, often heard of England, and your
literature is not unfamiliar to me. My
secretary reads to me the works of your
popular poet, <span class="sc">Robert Browning</span>.</p>

<p><em>Int.</em> Do you not, with your&mdash;er&mdash;limited
knowledge, if I may so say, of our language,
find that writer's meaning somewhat
obscure?</p>

<p><em>D. F.</em> Oh no; for my secretary translates him into idiomatic
French verse at sight.</p>

<p><em>Int.</em> <span class="sc">M. Zola</span> has also only recently discovered us. How do your
novelists find the necessary models for their English types?</p>

<p><em>D. F.</em> Nothing simpler. Tradition, <em>voilà tout</em>. The Englishwoman,
with her large feet, projecting teeth, and execrable French&mdash;we
know her because we have always known her. It is not necessary
to have seen her in the flesh. Indeed, it is only a marvel to me that
I find the type so rare in its own country.</p>

<p><em>Int.</em> Might I dare to ascribe such traditional views to the prejudice
of ignorance? Your Press, I believe, does not educate itself by
foreign travel.</p>

<p><em>D. F.</em> I cannot speak for others, but personally, if I do not offend
the laws of courtesy by saying this in the city whose hospitality I
now enjoy, I detest your race. I regard you as insular.</p>

<p><em>Int.</em> We cannot, of course, help being born on an island. But we
correct this defect by constant visits to the mainland, and from these
we have learnt a profound respect for the tastes of our neighbours.</p>

<p><em>D. F.</em> I am greatly gratified by this. Nothing has impressed me
so favourably here as your cordial appreciation of our people.
I met a distinguished British novelist who was actually acquainted
with the literature of my own Provence!</p>

<p><em>Int.</em> May I ask what other features of our comparatively inaccessible
island have attracted your notice?</p>

<p><em>D. F.</em> Above all things else, the sinister silence of your city. On
the Stock Exchange, down Cheapside, among vendors of journals,
you can hear a pin drop. Everywhere the taciturnity of the tomb.</p>

<p><em>Int.</em> And what of our institutions and types?</p>

<p><em>D. F.</em> Nothing has impressed me so deeply as the Great Wheel at
Earl's Court. It is a monument of national ardour and aspiration.
This, and Mr. <span class="sc">Stanley</span>, and your guardsmen, and your way of
cooking meat, have left the most indelible impression upon my
sentiment and constitution. I dislike the last two of them.</p>

<p><em>Int.</em> In cooking, we freely yield you the saucepan. But how has
our military given you offence?</p>

<p><em>D. F.</em> I object to the size of its chest, and its manner of occupying
the pavement. I have seen a guardsman in Whitehall
against whom, in the heyday of my youth, I should indubitably
have projected my person.</p>

<p><em>Int.</em> It would have been a rash and perhaps irreparable act. But
tell me more. Kindly hold up once again the veracious mirror, that
we may see ourselves as others see us. We are so apt to be blind to
our own national defects, unless the impartial observer, like yourself,
throws a flood of light upon our idiosyncrasies.</p>

<p><em>D. F.</em> I should like a few more days in which to complete my
study, and verify my anticipations, of your interesting city. Meanwhile,
let me refer you to M. <span class="sc">Gabriel Mourey's</span> new work&mdash;<em>Passé
le Détroit</em>. The Ulysses of our century, he has gained a wide knowledge
of your race, having been a fearless traveller in <em>L'Underground</em>,
and seen some of your most typical fogs. You may learn much from
him. He is read eagerly at home, where the thirst for books of
romantic travel and exploration grows hourly. I wish you the good
day. <em>Yes.</em></p>

Master of Elibank, the Liberal candidate for West Edinburgh, the
following "heckle" took place:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>
"<em>Mr. Guy.</em> Seeing you approve of Home Rule all round, what is the
smallest number of Parliaments the United Kingdom would require?
(<em>Laughter and a Voice:</em> 'Send it back to Parliament Square.')</p>

<p><em>The Master of Elibank.</em> I think that is a question which can be settled by
an ordinary addition sum. (<em>Cheers and laughter.</em>)"
</p></blockquote>

<p>Which shows that the Master is a real Master of Arts as well as of
Elibank, and, as regards platform difficulties, good at getting out.
But whether he is equally good at "getting in" the future must

<h2 class="sans">ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.</h2>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Extracted from the Diary of Toby, M.P.</span></p>

<p><em>House of Commons, Monday, May 20.</em>&mdash;<span class="sc">James
Galloway Weir</span> is a sore man the
night. Ross and Cromarty hide their diminished
head&mdash;or should it be heads?&mdash;before
the illuminated mountain tops of Inverness-shire.
<span class="sc">The MacGregor</span> has done him at
last, done him hopelessly. Since the present
Parliament met, he and <span class="sc">The MacGregor</span>
have run pretty evenly, neck and neck in race
to show what Scotland can do in this way
when it concentrates its mighty mind on the
effort. In former times Ireland had monopoly
of the Crank as he was returned to Parliament.
Scotch Members preserved traditional
reputation of their country as the
home of dour-headed businesslike men. <span class="sc">Weir</span>
standing alone would have sufficed to tear
this fable to tatters. <span class="sc">The MacGregor</span> unaided
would have confounded the tradition.
The combination of talent was irresistible,
overpowering in its force of conviction.</p>

<p>Between these eminent men there has been,
from the first, a feeling of generous rivalry.
<span class="sc">The MacGregor</span>, as befitted the riper
genius, has been more successful in concealing
it. Whenever he has put a question
about the Crofters, <span class="sc">Weir</span> has managed to
drop in with supplementary inquiry. His
name appearing in the report, watchful
Scotia would take note that <span class="sc">The MacGregor</span>
was not the only one of her sons who, in a
foreign land, cared for her interests. <span class="sc">The
MacGregor</span>, on the contrary, not less loftily
because without apparent design, ignored
<span class="sc">Weir</span>. There is reason to believe he did not
regard with fullest measure of appreciation
his intellectual capacity, his business aptitude,
or his parliamentary manner.</p>

<p>"A puir creature!" he said, one night,
staring straight up at the gaslit roof. There
was no one up there at the moment, and as
this happened to be the night when <span class="sc">Weir</span>
had eleven questions on the paper, by way
of showing his want of confidence in the
Government, and was approaching the ninth
with ever deepening chest notes, there is too
much reason to fear that at that moment the
Member for Inverness-shire was not unconscious
of the existence of the Member for
Ross and Cromarty.</p>

<p><span class="sc">James Galloway's</span> boot-issuing and blood-curdling
tones; his tragic reiteration of the
phrase, "Is the right hon. gentleman a
Weir?" The solemn sweep of his arm as he
places the reluctant <em>pince-nez</em> on his disputatious
nose; his stare of haughty surprise
when Lowlanders opposite titter at his inquiry
about the lost handle of the parish pump in
outraged Pitlochrie; his habit of turning up
at unexpected places on either side of the
House below the Gangway&mdash;these things are
unique in their way. In the aggregate they
would, save for <span class="sc">The MacGregor</span>, have placed
him on an unapproachable pinnacle. After
to-night he will reign alone. The other King
of the Bedlam Brentford has abdicated. But
evermore there will rest over <span class="sc">James Galloway</span>
the chill shadow of the mighty triumph with
which his rival closed his public career.</p>

<p>Nothing in the parliamentary life of <span class="sc">The
MacGregor</span> became him so well as its quittance.
The artful way in which he led the
<span class="sc">Squire of Malwood</span> up to confession of intent
with respect to the Crofters Bill; the
<span class="sc">Squire's</span> humble plea to wait till Thursday;
the <span class="sc">MacGregor's</span> stern response, "That is
not good enough for me;" then his swinging
march down the Gangway (almost you could
hear the pibroch playing); his halt before the
Mace; his stately bow to the <span class="sc">Speaker</span>; the
march resumed; the fresh halt at the Bar;
another sweeping obeisance (again fancy
feigned the faint sound of the distant pibroch),
and the <span class="sc">MacGregor</span> was o'er the border,
and awa'.</p>

<p>"A puir daft body," said <span class="sc">James Galloway
Weir</span>, his musing sight, by strange
coincidence, also fixed on the ceiling.</p>

<p><em>Business done.</em>&mdash;<span class="sc">The MacGregor</span> shakes
the dust of the House of Commons from off
his feet. In disordered state of things that
followed, paralysed Government escaped
defeat in Committee on Welsh Disestablishment
Bill by narrow majority of nine.</p>

<p><em>Tuesday.</em>&mdash;Surely never was such a place
in the world as House of Commons for bifurcations.
Within memory of man there was a
time when, of two sides of the political highway,
Liberals trod one, Conservatives paced
the other. Now House is broken up into half
a dozen parties, each with its infinitude of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page264" id="page264"></a>[pg 264]</span>
sections. Most depressing and disappointing development of this
tendency appears to-night. The Eldest-Son Party is just bereft of
one of its most active members by <span class="sc">Wolmer's</span> accession to Earldom.
General <span class="sc">George Curzon</span>, whose forces, on full muster, counted two,
is now reduced, on Queen's Birthdays and other State occasions, to
reviewing <span class="sc">St. John Brodrick</span>, <em>seul.</em> Force of habit still strong,
and, when speaking to-night, he made House acquainted with the
views on constitutional question which "I and my friends hold."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 350px;"><a href="images/264a-1000.png"><img src="images/264a-350.png" width="350" height="474" alt="The MacGregor retires to his Cave." /></a>
<h4><span class="sc">The MacGregor retires to his Cave.</span></h4>

<p><em>Mr. W-r.</em> "Mon, if I hadna thocht he was jokin', I wad ha' gone mysel',&mdash;to
be even wi' 'im!"</p></div>

<p>It may be singular, but so is the number of the friends. <span class="sc">Cranborne</span>,
in one of his fiery speeches, made it clear just now that the
Eldest Sons are divided on the question which General <span class="sc">George
Curzon</span>, Quartermaster-General <span class="sc">St. John Brodrick</span>, and the late
Army (now gone to another place) made their own. This defection
from within not made up by sustentation from without. <span class="sc">Joseph</span>,
having got a little mixed between what he said on Coleridge peerage
case, and the exact reverse put forward by him with equal confidence
on the Selborne case, judiciously absented himself to-night. <span class="sc">Courtney</span>
also absent. <span class="sc">Prince Arthur</span> sat ominously silent on Front
Bench, whilst <span class="sc">Dick Webster</span> backed up <span class="sc">Squire of Malwood</span> in
denouncing position assumed by General <span class="sc">George</span> and Quartermaster-General
<span class="sc">St. John</span>. As for the Army, multitudinously alluded to as
"the Hon. <span class="sc">William Waldegrave Palmer</span>, commonly called
Viscount <span class="sc">Wolmer</span>, now Earl of <span class="sc">Selborne</span>," it was withdrawn,
interned as garrisons are at particular crises of civic life. House
gladly ordered issue of new writ for West Edinburgh. Constitution
remains unreformed, and <span class="sc">William Waldegrave</span>&mdash;to quote with
slight variation from the appropriate source of tombstone literature&mdash;</p>

<p><em>Business done.</em>&mdash;Clause III. added to Welsh Disestablishment Bill.</p>

<p><em>Thursday.</em>&mdash;The Bashful <span class="sc">Bartley</span>, temporarily overcoming a constitutional
weakness that is the despair of his friends, and has proved
a serious block in the way of his public advancement, put himself
forward just now. Is disturbed by dalliance of Lord <span class="sc">Brassey</span>, sometime
ago appointed Governor of Victoria. <span class="sc">Bartley</span> has conviction
that if, in good time coming, his party should acknowledge faithful
service by appointing him to Governorship, he would lose no time in
entering upon his new sphere of usefulness. That course Lord <span class="sc">Brassey</span>
might be expected to follow. "Instead of which, he goes about the
country&mdash;stealing ducks," <span class="sc">Bartley</span>, impelled by swing of the quotation,
was about to add. Pulling himself up in time, he added,
"making party political speeches in favour of candidates at elections."</p>

<p><span class="sc">Sydney Buxton</span>, in his most Severe-Young-Man-manner, informed
the not quite Blameless <span class="sc">Bartley</span> that <span class="sc">Brassey</span> not yet set
out to undertake Governorship of Victoria because he is not yet
Governor. <span class="sc">Hopetoun's</span> term does not expire till September, and
unless it were desired to run the risk of a sort of colonial <em>Box and
Cox</em> scene, it would be well he should await the due date of his
succession.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Bartley</span> blushed, said nothing&mdash;at least, not aloud. To himself
muttered, "They may say what they like; but, after all, bashfulness
is the best policy."</p>

<p>The <span class="sc">Tiresome Tomlinson</span> so affected by this repulse of an
esteemed friend and neighbour that when, later in sitting, <span class="sc">Bartley</span>,
forgetting his pious resolve, moved amendment to Budget Bill
exempting a wife's revenues from income-tax, T. T., rushing out to
support him in division lobby, lost the way. When he arrived at
lobby door, found it locked. Rattled at handle; kicked panel.
For only reply came whisper through keyhole, in voice he recognised
as <span class="sc">Tommy Bowles'</span>: "Too late. Go away, you foolish virgin."</p>

<p>"Bad enough," said T. T., "to lose chance of voting against the
Government. But why <span class="sc">Tommy Bowles</span> should call me a foolish
virgin, I don't know. Do I look like one?"</p>

<p><em>Business done.</em>&mdash;Scotch Grand Committee set up. Opposition
straightway go and gather sticks wherewith to knock it down.</p>

<p><em>Friday.</em>&mdash;Came across little group in lobby just now steeped in
brackish waters of tribulation. Only three of them, but they
seemed to have all the trouble of the world divided amongst them.</p>

<p>"What's the matter?" I asked. "Been listening to two hours'
debate on Budget Bill in Committee?"</p>

<p>"Worse than that," said <span class="sc">Hart Dyke</span>. "Haven't you heard?
<span class="sc">Carmarthen</span>, riding out on his bicycle, came by sudden turn on
steam-roller. Bicycle shied; pitched <span class="sc">Dolly</span> off."</p>

<p>"Poor <span class="sc">Dolly</span>!" said <span class="sc">John Penn</span>, mopping his eye with a J pen-wiper.
"He fell on his head."</p>

<p><span class="sc">Hart Dyke</span> and <span class="sc">Mark Lockwood</span> (together)&mdash;"Oh, then he's not
hurt." Sudden brightening of faces as load of apprehension removed
from mind; walked off quite cheerfully.</p>

<p>Gracious, kind-hearted comrades! So pleasant, amid turmoil of
political warfare, to come upon idyllic scene like this, and learn how
sweet a thing is friendship.</p>

<p><em>Business done.</em>&mdash;Budget Bill through Committee.</p>

<p>["The <span class="sc">Chancellor of the Exchequer</span> said that the right hon. member
for St. George's had referred to the fact that this was leap year, and they all
knew that in leap year proposals could be made that would be considered
rather extraordinary in ordinary times. (<em>Laughter.</em>) To accept the right
hon. gentleman's proposal would not be consistent with his duty."&mdash;<em>Times.</em>]</p></div>
